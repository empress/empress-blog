[Chris Manson](https://twitter.com/real_ate) is a Ember enthusiast and a member of the [Ember Core Learning Team](https://emberjs.com/team). empress-blog was an experimental project that came out of the work on converting the [Ember Guides](https://guides.emberjs.com) to be a static Ember application. empress-blog has since inspired the creation of [Guidemaker](https://github.com/empress/guidemaker) and is a driving force for the evolution of the Ember static site ecosystem.

empress-blog is entirely open source so if you want to see how it works or if you would like to contribute please [check out the git repository](https://github.com/empress/empress-blog).
