Hey! Welcome to empress-blog, it's great to have you :)

We know that first impressions are important, so we've populated your new site with some initial **Getting Started** posts that will help you get familiar with everything in no time. This is the first one!


### There are a few things that you should know up-front:

1. empress-blog is designed to be a static site version of the amazing [Ghost blogging platform](https://ghost.org/)

1. empress-blog is designed for developers who know how to deploy a static site (folder of html files and assets) using something like S3 or even just on NGINX.

1. If you are slightly less tech savvy or if you want to manage your blog outside of just a set of files in a git repo we highly recommend signing up for [Ghost](https://ghost.org/pricing/)

### Quick Start

```bash
# if you don't have ember-cli installed already
npm install -g ember-cli

ember new super-blog
cd super-blog

ember install empress-blog empress-blog-casper-template
```

It will ask you if you want to update the `index.html` file and you should say yes üëç

If you want to see the blog system running on your local machine just run `npm start` and you will
be able to navigate to  [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to see the blog in action.

The main thing you'll want to read about next is probably: [editing files with empress-blog](/the-editor/).

Once you're done reading, you can simply delete the default **Ghost** user from your team to remove all of these introductory posts!
